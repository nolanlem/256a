readme for 256a 


BasicAudio01 is a juce project that shows a simple additive synthesis 
model. It initializes 5 oscillators with individual on/off, frequency, 
gain, and trigger controls. I wrote a brownian(ish) motion function that 
gets applied to the frequency of each oscillator that enables it to 
drift around the frequency set by the slider.
